This is an assignment for a class called Deep Learning in Discrete Optimization in the Applied Math & Statistics Department at the Johns Hopkins University. I created my own neural network for the first time, and it classifies whether an undirected graph is connected or not. 

In the .txt files, each line contains a graph, where the edges are indicated by a 0-1 vector. The last character is the ground truth indicating whether the graph is connected or not.
